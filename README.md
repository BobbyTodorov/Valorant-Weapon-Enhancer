# ValorantWeaponEnhancer
### Application with UI (JavaFX)

Open source enhancer for Valorant's weapons.


*Intro:*  
Valorant is Riot Games' shooter game.  
This tool enhances some of Valorant's weapons' firing abilities.  
  
*Explanation:*  
"Click-to-fire" guns can now fire automatically by holding the fire mouse button.  
Reclicking it is not necesarry anymore as it de-focuses your aiming.  
  
For example, by holding left mouse button, "Guardian", "Ghost", "Sheriff" and others  
"click-to-fire" guns will now act as if they were "hold-to-fire".  
The firing speed can be regulated by a slider.   
  
    
⚠️ *Valorant uses "Vanguard service" as cheat protection. ValorantWeaponEnhancer is just a running process in your system that can not be detected by Vanguard. Even if it could, it DOES NOT change any game files but is working completely externally to the game.
However, any guarantees are not provided and using this software is at your own risk.*
